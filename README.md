# machine-learning-challenge

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In order to complete this assignment, I will need to:
- Preprocess the raw data
- Tune the models
- Compare two or more models
